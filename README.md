# Meat-the-Economy, using the Meatmerizor model

# Project Description
Meat the Economy / Meatmerizor -  
# Project Goals
Create a model to predict the country’s economic state based on the country’s meat consumption patterns. 
# Data Collection
National meat eating history (From Kaggle)
Global economic data (From Kaggle)
Datasets: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scibearia/meat-consumption-per-capita

# Data Modeling
Polynomial/Linear Regression - starting with simple regression
Classification Model/ Logistic regression 
# Data Visualization
Heatmaps
Scatterplots
# Test Plan
We are most likely going to start by building predictive models for a few countries of our choosing and comparing their outputs to established data from government websites to see if our model is predicting correctly. 
We will then slowly add more countries until we finish a constructive that has all our countries and predicts out ten years. 
First, we’ll meatmerize data for Jamaica, Nepal, Egypt, Nigeria, and the United States from 1961-2021
